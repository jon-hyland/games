 GAME SERVER
=============

- GameServer is a .NET Core 3.1 console application and generally configured to
  run as a Linux service.  It was designed for the Raspberry Pi 2 and above, 
  but has been tested on Windows and should run on most any OS.
- GameServer provides multi-player support for the Bricker game, and any future
  game written using this framework.
- GameServer listens for TCP connections on port 8780.
- For external access, configure internet router to forward incoming TCP port
  8780 to the GameServer's IP.
- Games are configured (by default) to connect to host 'hyland.one'.
