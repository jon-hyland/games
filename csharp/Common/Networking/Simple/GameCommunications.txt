 GAME COMMUNICATIONS
=====================
- Each game starts an instance of Coms.
- Each instance starts a server on game port.
- Each instance uses UDP broadcasting to announce itself.
- One game can initiate a connection to another, but connecting to the other's port.
- The other will then connect to it's port.
- Only one connection per game, this library is only 1:1.
- Same port used for TCP coms and UDP broadcast discovery.
